NOTES:
- To download or clone the repository press the green "<> Code" button
- Let me know if you have any questions : D
- U need to download BOTH assignments and labs (unfortunately Brightspace doesn't let you preview .py files like Blackboard)

STEPS to use the program:

- First, for both, navigate to the submission list for that assignment on Brightspace and select the files you want to download 
- Once you've downloaded and unzipped the package ...

- Get the file path (select the unzipped folder from Brightspace in your Finder, hold the option key, and copy file path on Mac)

- Paste pathname of the assignment or lab into the quotation marks in ASSIGNMENT_PATH 
- Run the program
- Specify if you're trying to clean an "assignment" or "lab" 

The cleaned-up files should be in the folder that you gave the file path for
Assignments 
- will have the folder and Python file for each student if the student did so
Labs
- will have a series of 1 .py file per student
