U need to download BOTH assignments and labs (unfortunately Brightspace doesn't let you preview .py files like Blackboard)

First, for both, navigate to the submission list for that assignment on Brightspace and select the files you want to download 
Once you've downloaded and unzipped the package ...

Get the file path (select the unzipped folder from Brightspace in your Finder, hold the option key, and copy file path on Mac)

Paste pathname of the assignment or lab into the quotation marks in ASSIGNMENT_PATH 
Run the program
Specify if you're trying to clean an "assignment" or "lab" 

The cleaned-up files should be in the folder that you gave the file path for
